                <h2>Hi, I'm Ashley!</h2>
                <h3>A UX/UI Designer from Austin, TX.</h3>
                <p>
                    I have a B.S. in Biology from St. Edward’s University. I pursued a career in the medical field for a few years but was not fully content. Looking for a career change I came across UX/UI and absolutely loved it. I enjoy being able to take a problem and find a simple, viable solution. From there, I completed the UT UX/UI Bootcamp where I learned so much and was able to complete a few projects.

                    Working in design I’ve been able to use my creative side, and I noticed that the scientific method is somewhat applied when researching. In order to create a great design you need to define the problem, create a hypothesis, do some research, figure out your method (ideate), and test your solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of designing I love staying active, whether it’s lifting at my favorite gym or hanging with friends and playing sports (mostly basketball). I also love playing video games and chilling with my pup.
